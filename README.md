# axelo-mobile

## Running the project
1. Make sure you have a running Expo installation on your phone and npm installed on your computer.
2. Type in: 
```shell
npx expo start
```
3. After typing in the command, you will see a barcode on your terminal. 
    * For iOS, scan that with the Camera app. That would launch the Expo app.
    * For Android, open the Expo app, and scan the barcode from over that.

You will see a brief interlude. That means that Expo is trying to bundle the Javascript source into an Electron executable. After a while, the app shall start and you should see logs of accelerometer data on your terminal.
